# CS463-Professional-Website-Alan-Schaaf

Welcome to my website! This is a professional website that I created for my final project for CS463 at Portland State University. It was implemented using the skills that I learned in the class related to web development and design. On my website you will find an About section where I summarize my professional experience, a Skills section where I highlight the languages I am comfortable working in and the CS classes I have completed thus far, a Projects section where I showcase two projects that I have worked on, and a contact section where you can fill out a form to contact me (the form does not currently submit anything when you push submit). Enjoy my website!
